      <h1 class="mt-3">About Us</h1>
      <p>Waves for Change is a youth-led environmental initiative dedicated to tackling plastic pollution and promoting sustainability through community-driven action. Founded in June 2024, our project began with a simple yet powerful idea: transforming discarded plastic bottles into plant pots and using them to create positive change. What started as a series of small beach cleanups quickly grew into a movement, bringing together passionate volunteers to restore our coastlines while repurposing waste into something meaningful.</p>
      <h4 class="mt-1">Our Mission</h1>
      <p>At Waves for Change, we strive to create a cleaner, greener world by merging environmental conservation with social impact. Through regular beach cleanups, creative upcycling, and community engagement, we aim to reduce plastic waste, raise awareness, and support charitable causes.</p>
      <h4 class="mt-1">Our Vision</h1> 
      <p>We envision a future where sustainability is second natureâ€”where waste is minimized, oceans are plastic-free, and communities unite to protect the environment. By inspiring action and fostering innovation, we hope to drive long-term change, one bottle, one beach, and one community at a time.</p>
